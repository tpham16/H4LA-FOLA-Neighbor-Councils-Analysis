Students enrolled in the program have been identified as homeless through the school districts under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. For the last ten years, this program has provided food and nutrition education for children and families in need. Each child in the program receives enough food for three to four family members throughout the weekend. Because these students do not have access to the free and reduced breakfast and lunch programs over the weekend, this sustainable food source ensures that they always receive the nutrition they need. Due to the stigma attached to homelessness, the program is presented as a Weekend Nutrition Club where students can learn about proper nutrition. Not open to the public, must be enrolled through school.

Basic Needs Program- Giving for Living is Giving Children Hope’s donation redistribution center.

Project FIESTA provides free groceries and school supplies to needy families with elementary school children enrolled in the free meals program (Title I Schools). Low-Income parents attend educational classes, then they receive free goods and commit to help their children read and excel in school. Parents also make a commitment to help their children achieve perfect attendance and to excel academically. This helps bring about a school, teacher, family relationship together in an uplifting environment. Results have proven that getting parents involved, giving free products, which help with the family budgets has a very positive impact for the families, the children, school attendance, grades and overall attitude about learning and their school community.

Through its outreach programs New Horizons nourishes a better understanding of other services available within the community, and how Parents, Teachers and Caregivers in their own special way can better serve and support each other to strengthen the fiber of the community

On your first visit, please arrive by the time the pantry first opens in the morning in order to register as a new participant and receive the complete program orientation.

We request official photo identification of first-time participants as well as identification for each additional household member showing that all are living at the same address. Please bring birth certificates for minor children.

You will also need to bring acceptable proof of residency.  A driver’s license is not considered acceptable proof of residency.

Examples include payroll check stubs, utility or telephone bills, credit card bills, bank statements, mortgage bill, government benefits check, current year jury summons, current year property tax bill or motor vehicle registration.

You may visit the SOVA pantry once in each calendar month and receive groceries for all eligible household members. Grocery orders are sized according to the number of household members. If you are homeless and do not have refrigeration and/or cooking facilities, you may visit twice each month.

Please inform the SOVA volunteer of special dietary requirements so that your order can be packed appropriately (example: no meat, no pork, low salt, low sugar, Kosher, etc.).",English,,,"Provide support on housing, homelessness, legal matters, enroll you in benefits such as CalFresh, MediCal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4
